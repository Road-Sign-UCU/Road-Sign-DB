- ## Description:

This project was made to analyze three chosen datasets, which contain road sign photos and their description.

Modules for reformatting and converting data from used datasets are based on _basedataset.py_ module.

These modules collect data into one datatset, which is later being analyzed.

At the end we get builded charts, which represent analyzed data and show us the results.

- ## Installation and setup:

Requirements:

1*. ```virtualenv -p python3 venv```
2*. ```source venv/bin/activate```
3. ```pip install road-signs-db-convertion-michael```
4. ```python -m database_convertion```

- ## Usage 

The completed modules and three already added databases can be used for the further research on this theme. All modules are working, and you can add your database, write the separate module for processing it, and widen the analyzed data.

- ## Support
